# Slim Framework 3 Skeleton App with ReadBeanPHP ORM

I created this skeleton base application to quickly setup and start working on a new Slim Framework 3 application.

It includes:

- Monolog
- RedBeanPHP
- phpdotenv

## Install the Application

Run this command from the directory in which you want to clone your new Slim Framework skeleton application.

    git clone https://github.com/yazdroid/slimbean.git

* Point your virtual host document root to your new application's `public/` directory.
* Ensure `logs/` is web writeable.

## Notes 
This is a Work In Progress, so forgive the lack of documentation yet.
